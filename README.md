## Features

For now, this browser extension only does one thing, but 
I suspect that this plugin may be expanded with new features
in the future.

### Meetings

#### Open a new incognito window for each meeting participant.

We have to schedule & test meetings often, and opening up 
an incognito window for each user can be repetitive. 
This plugin adds a button that will open a new incognito window for 
each meeting participant, speeding up the process of joining test meetings.
